About
=====

Checks the state of the computer for the current user to determine whether sending a notification is appropriate.<br/>
This is a [FFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface) wrapper to the Windows win32 shell API [SHQueryUserNotificationState](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shqueryusernotificationstate) function (_shell32.dll_).

Example
=======

```js
import { queryUserNotificationState } from 'notification-state-ffi';

const state = queryUserNotificationState();
console.log(state); 
//QUNS_ACCEPTS_NOTIFICATIONS (notifications can be freely sent) 

//If you prefer the raw data instead:

const state = queryUserNotificationState({translate: false});
console.log(state); 
//5 (notifications can be freely sent)
```

You can use this to easily know if an application is currently running in fullscreen (_main monitor_):

```js
import { isFullscreenAppRunning } from 'notification-state-ffi';

if (isFullscreenAppRunning()){
  //Do something
}
```

Installation
============

```
npm install notification-state-ffi
```

_Prerequisite: C/C++ build tools (Visual Studio) and Python 3.x (node-gyp) in order to build [node-ffi-napi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffi-napi)._<br/>
_üí° Prebuilt binaries are provided so in most cases the above mentioned prerequisites aren't needed._

API
===

‚ö†Ô∏è This module is only available as an ECMAScript module (ESM)<br />

üí° Promises are under the `promises` namespace.
```js
import * as shell32 from 'notification-state-ffi';
shell32.promises.queryUserNotificationState() //Promise
shell32.queryUserNotificationState() //Sync

import * as shell32 from 'notification-state-ffi/promises';

## Named export

### `queryUserNotificationState(option?: object): number | string`

Checks the state of the computer for the current user to determine whether sending a notification is appropriate.

‚öôÔ∏è Options:

- translate?: boolean (true)

When a value is known it will be 'translated' to its string equivalent value otherwise its integer value.<br/>
If you want the raw data only set it to false.

Return value:

‚úîÔ∏è If this function succeeds, it returns [QUERY_USER_NOTIFICATION_STATE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/ne-shellapi-query_user_notification_state):<br/>

```
QUNS_NOT_PRESENT (1): A screen saver is displayed, the machine is locked, or a nonactive Fast User Switching session is in progress
QUNS_BUSY"(2): A fullscreen application is running or Presentation Settings are applied
QUNS_RUNNING_D3D_FULL_SCREEN(3): A fullscreen (exclusive mode) Direct3D application is running
QUNS_PRESENTATION_MODE(4): The user has activated Windows presentation settings to block notifications and pop-up messages
QUNS_ACCEPTS_NOTIFICATIONS(5): None of the other states are found, notifications can be freely sent
QUNS_QUIET_TIME(6): The current user is in 'quiet time', which is the first hour after a new user logs into his or her account for the first time after an operating system upgrade or clean installation
QUNS_APP(7): A Windows Store app is running fullscreen
```

‚ùå Otherwise, it throws with the corresponding HRESULT error code.

Example:

```js
queryUserNotificationState({translate: true}) //QUNS_BUSY (string)
queryUserNotificationState({translate: false}) //2 (number)
```

### `isFullscreenAppRunning(): boolean`

Uses `queryUserNotificationState()` to easily know if an application is currently running in fullscreen on the user's primary display.

Return value:

‚úîÔ∏è Returns whether an application is currently running in fullscreen.<br/>
If `queryUserNotificationState()` fails then `false` is assumed.
